# Text-Based Hotel Review Retrieval System

 "IR_Project_Group40.pdf" consists of the Report of our project. <br /> <br />
 "Models" Folder consists of our models we ran as baselines. <br />
    (The Random Forest Model Drive Link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-JUj_yGH9jAyhfBeW19bq_6BAttwjSYI/view?usp=sharing )   <br /> <br />
  "Pre-processing" Folder consists of all the python code used during preprocessing of our data. <br />
         --> In ParsePrimary.py, we did the basic cleaning of data, i.e, extracting the hotel and location name from the url present in the reviews, and removing the reviews with no property dictionary present. <br />
         --> In FetchRecords.py, we extracted the reviews which contained the same 6 parameters being rated. <br />
         --> In ProcessText.py, we implemented the basic preprocessing steps such as (i) conversion to lowercase, (ii) Removing Punctuation and Stopwords and (iii) Stemming the words. <br /> <br />
   "IR_Proj.ipynb" consists of our notebook where everything was implemented. <br /> <br />
   "END-SEM WORK" Directory consists of work done after Mid Sem <br /> <br />
   "IR_Project_Group40_Final.pdf" is the Final Report of our project. <br /> <br />
   "IR_Proj_Final.ipynb" is the final python notebook that we used in our project . <br /> <br />
   "Testing_diff_models.ipynb" is the python notebook that we used for running our models on larger dataset(500k reviews) . <br /> <br />
   
   "User Interface" is the directory consisting of UI code. <br /> <br />
    "IR_Project_Group40.pdf" consists of the Report of our project. <br /> <br />
